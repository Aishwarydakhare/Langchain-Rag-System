# Langchain-Rag-System


🔍 What is the RAG System?
RAG combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to deliver accurate, contextually relevant responses. Leveraging Langchain's tools and Google Generative AI, we've built a system that understands document context and generates precise answers to user queries. 📖➡️💬
🛠 Key Technologies Used:
Document Loader: PyPDFLoader for seamless PDF handling.
Text Splitter: NLTKTextSplitter for efficient document segmentation.
Vector Store: Chroma for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
Generative AI: GoogleGenerativeAI for crafting responses based on context.
Interface: Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.
🌈 User Interface:
Our Streamlit-based interface empowers users to input questions and receive real-time, context-aware responses from the "Leave No Context Behind" paper! 💬
🚀 Next Steps:
We're committed to enhancing the system's capabilities and integrating advanced features. Stay tuned for updates! 🔄
